# CSE460 : VLSI Design

## Course Objective:
- The objectives of this course are to give a brief introduction to the complete process of chip designing
- Provide background knowledge to design, simulate and implement combinational & sequential CMOS circuits
- Teach theoretical concepts to critically analyze the cost & performance of an IC
- Expose the students to the physical design aspects of CMOS IC design
- Introduce the necessary programming language/softwares such as: Verilog (programming language), Quartus II, Microwind & DSCH2 to design, simulate, visualize and verify CMOS logic circuits and layouts
